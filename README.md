It is a collection of different open-source software applications that work together to provide **an operational system for a community.  
**The goal is to provide a digital infrastucture that could fullfill any community needs, being at the same time highly modular and easy to change according to each specific community needs and decisions .  
![](/assets/ex.png)Adopting a shared syntax, inside an Open Cooperative Ecosystem any kind of events can be represented:

* _flexible networks of networks relationships_
* _resource management and recipes_
* _planning and coordination for producing, using, exchanging and sharing value_
* _tracking events that produce, use, exchange and share value_
* _tracking contributions from individual network members of work and resources_
* _connecting value streams from idea to manufacture to end use and following them back_
* _distributing income according to contributions using "value equation" decided by contributors_
* _accounting views for a network, organization, project, individual_

The main point of an Open Cooperative Ecosystem is that _**everything is connected to everything else**_, thanks to its underlying syntax model: [**REA**](/Concepts/rea.md)**. **The acronym stands for _Resources,_ _Events_ and _Agents._ It is the [ISO economic and accounting standard.](http://jtc1sc32.org/doc/N1051-1100/32N1083-CD15944-4-wg1n266.pdf) It can handle any economic relationships, value networks and ecological requirements.  
These can occur at any level of economic activity.The basic pattern is that resources flow into and out of processes through input and output events; and resources flow from one agent to another through give/take events in exchanges. Resources can flow through processes and exchanges in any order:
