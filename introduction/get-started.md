## Getting Started

There are opportunities to work on:
* New small apps that will become part of the Open Cooperative Ecosystem
* Bug fixes and maintenance to existing apps
* Sysadmin help
* New api's and translations between apps with different api's

(Where can people go to discuss specific options?  I couldn't find the link to OCE - Development in telegram.)
